# Engine
---   
This is where we'll experiment with the various parts of the backend / etc.

## Tasks to do:   
- Play around with Infinigen and figure out how we'll best want to incorporate this
- Get TRELLIS running on DSMLP / datahub
- Build Flask API for TRELLIS
- Potentially make systems optimizations to get TRELLIS ready for real-time inference
- Build frameworks for text-to-3d assets (likely use reprompting w/ calls to 4o-mini) and for image-to-3d assets (figure out API calls for image gen and various image processing we should do prior to passing into TRELLIS)
